1 Project Overview:

The Forex Trading Signal AI Agent is an intelligent trading analytics system designed to gen-
erate buy, sell, and hold signals for foreign exchange markets using machine learning, technical
indicators, and quantitative analysis.
The system automates market monitoring, trend detection, signal generation, risk assess-
ment, and performance evaluation to support data-driven trading decisions.


2 Business Problem:

Foreign exchange markets are highly volatile and influenced by numerous economic, geopolitical,
and technical factors.
Manual trading presents several challenges:
• Delayed decision-making
• Emotional trading biases
• Difficulty monitoring multiple currency pairs
• Complex interpretation of market indicators
• Inefficient risk management
The AI Agent aims to provide consistent, data-driven trading signals that improve trading
efficiency and reduce decision-making errors.



3 Project Objectives:

• Analyze historical forex market data
• Generate automated trading signals
• Predict short-term market movements
• Identify profitable trading opportunities
• Implement risk management mechanisms
• Evaluate trading performance
• Provide actionable trading insights
